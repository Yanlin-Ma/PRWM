# Experimental file formats

## Packed Raw WebGL Model

The aim of this specification is to come up with a format for nD models which is fast to parse yet still relatively
lightweight and flexible. This format is specifically designed for WebGL and will probably prove useless
for any other platforms.

## Variable Precision Model and Variable Precision Bundle specifications

The aim of this specification is to come up with a compact and flexible format for static nD models.
